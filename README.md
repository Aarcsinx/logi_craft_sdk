The touch-sensitive control lets you feel your way through your creation - for a more efficient and immersive workflow.

## 2. Introduction to the Logitech Crown SDK

In this document, we describe how you can create a custom plugin/profile that maps your app/software functions to our unique rotary controller called Crown. The plugin will give you the ability to map your app functions depending on the context of your user. For instance, when a user select text, the font size could be adjusted via the Crown.

The plugin that you will create will reside in your app. And it will communicate directly to our Crown via the Logitech Options software.

## 3. Types of Apps and Benefits

The Crown controller can be mapped to a variety of functions inside your app and will be particularly interesting to the following type of applications.

- Productivity
- Photo / Video Editing
- Audio Creation / Audio Mixing
- 3D creation / Architecture

The Crown provides a natural and precise control for a variety of parameters like:

- Slider controls
- Timeline Navigation (Audio/Video)
- Scaling (Zoom in/out, Size, ...)
- Rotating thru Presets, Tabs
- Moving 3D objects
